# PacMan A* Search
# Overview

This project is a simple simulation of the classic Pac-Man game, implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game features Pac-Man, ghosts, walls, and pellets, with an AI-powered pathfinding mechanism for both Pac-Man and ghosts using the A search algorithm*.

# Features

âœ… Pac-Man Movement â€“ Uses A search* to navigate towards the nearest pellet.

ðŸ‘» AI and Random Ghosts â€“ One ghost intelligently chases Pac-Man using A search*, while others move randomly.

ðŸ§± Dynamic Grid â€“ Randomly generated walls and pellets on the game grid.

ðŸŽ® Classic Gameplay â€“ Collect all pellets to win, avoid ghosts to survive!

ðŸ“Š Score Tracking â€“ Score updates as Pac-Man collects pellets.

# How It Works
The game initializes a random grid of walls and pellets.

Pac-Man automatically finds the best path to the closest pellet using A search*.

Ghosts either chase Pac-Man (AI-controlled) or move randomly.

The game ends when Pac-Man collects all pellets (win) or collides with a ghost (lose).
